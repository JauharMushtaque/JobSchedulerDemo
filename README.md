# JobSchedulerDemo
Job Scheduler Demo App

you can use the AlarmManager class to trigger events based on the real-time clock, or based on elapsed time since boot.
Most tasks, however, do not require an exact time, but should be scheduled based on a combination of system and user requirements.
The JobScheduler class allows you to set the conditions, or parameters, for when to run your task.
